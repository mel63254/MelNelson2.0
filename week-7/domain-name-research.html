        <h2>What is an internet domain name?</h2>
        
        <p>
          I found the answer to the above question on this <a href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">Wiki page</a> A 
          domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within 
          the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing 
          purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, 
          such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself 
          or any other service communicated via the Internet.

        <h2>Why are domain names so important on the web?</h2>
        <p>
          I found the answer to the above question on <a href:"https://www.allbusiness.com/why-domain-names-are-so-important-681-1.html">All Business</a>
          On a basic level, domain names are important because the Internet’s addressing scheme is not very effective without them. 
          A domain name adds credibility to your small business, says you’re forward-thinking, and adds mobility to your Internet presence.
          The right domain name can attract walk-in business. A domain name builds your brand.

        <h2>Why do domain names have to be unique?</h2>
        
        <p>
          I found the answer to the above question on <a href:"https://www.relentlesshosting.com.au/why-domain-names-are-important/">Relentless Hosting</a>
          For your website to have a unique identity, a domain name is essential. The domain name has to be unique to ensure that no 
          two parties hold the same domain name as this can create a problem and will defeat the purpose of building your brand identity. 
          Your domain name is not only your identity but your online business card as well.

        <h2>What does it mean to register a domain name?</h2>
        
        <p>
          I found the answer to the above question on <a href:"https://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/DomainRegister.asp">Webopedia</a>
          The only way to register and start using a domain name is to use the services of a domain name registrar. The domain 
          name industry is regulated and overseen by ICANN, the organization that is responsible for certifying companies as 
          domain name registrars. Domain registration is the process of registering a domain name, which identifies one or 
          more IP addresses with a name that is easier to remember and use in URLs to identify particular Web pages. The person 
          or business that registers domain name is called the domain name registrant.

          <dt><b>Hover</b></dt>
          
          Hover officially launched in 2009, but it’s an offshoot of Tucows Inc., which is the third-largest ICANN accredited registrar 
          online. Hover is essentially a merger of three big players in the domain registrar space. Hover is great in that they’re 
          incredibly straightforward. They offer domain registering and that’s it. For that reason it’s very easy to register a 
          domain with them, because that’s all they do. You won’t be bombarded with endless upsells and advertisements for other services 
          of theirs. The process of setting up your domain names is also quite seamless and their backend is quite nice to use. 
          Since they just focus their service around this one thing there support is also excellent, and you’ll always have a real 
          person handling your request. <strong>However, there are certain drawbacks to Hover.</strong> For starters, they don’t 
          offer hosting, if you’re looking for a bundled package, then you’ll have to look elsewhere. They are also <strong>pricier</strong>
          when compared to other domain registrars.
          
          <dt><b>Pricing</b></dt>
          
          They offer different pricing schemes based upon which top level domains you’re going to be using. However, .com domains start 
          at $12.99 for domain registration, $14.99 for a renewal, and $10.99 for transferring a domain name. For a more comprehensive 
          pricing list, take a look at their guidelines on their website.
