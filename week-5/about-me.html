      <div class="bit-columns"> <p>Wiki<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru"> Subaru
        is the automobile manufacturing division of Japanese transportation conglomerate Subaru 
        Corporation (formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries), the twenty-second largest automaker 
        by production worldwide in 2012.</p>
        <p>Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" 
          (one of whom tradition says is invisible â€“ hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), 
          which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.</p>
        <p>Fuji Heavy Industries started out as the Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by 
          Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and 
          soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the 
          Second World War, Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. 
          In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter, with spare aircraft parts from 
          the war. In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the 
          Japanese government's 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-zaibatsu legislation. 
          Between 1953 and 1955, five of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to 
          merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; 
          coachbuilders Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturers Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builders Utsunomiya 
          Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Sangyo trading company.</p>
