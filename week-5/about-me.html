                <h2>My birthplace</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Luverne MN.

                  I grew up in Southwest Minnesota. I moved to southeast South Dakota when I was in my early 20's. 
                  At age 23 I decided the Midwest was simply too small for me. So I packed up, and moved to Portland, OR. I spent 
                  an amazing two years down there before moving up here to the greater Seattle area.
