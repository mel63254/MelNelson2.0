<title>Chapter 5 Critical Thinking Questions (CTQ)</title>
3. <footer>(In your answer to this question, please use a specific organization to illustrate your understanding.) Several different rating formats are presented in the chapter. If you were designing a performance appraisal process for an organization, what types of scales or formats might you use (e.g., BARS, graphic scales)? Would you use paper-and pencil formats, or would you use a technology-based approach?  What rationale do  you have for your choices?</footer>

 while True:
	print (‘Hello World’)
<div>If I were designated a performance appraisal process, and I had to choose one we have covered I would choose Graphic Scale. However, more importantly, why must I choose only one of the formats? I am rather curious as to why reviews must be a “one size fits all”? Have you ever tried on a one size fits all? It usually ends up being a case of one size fits almost no one. When it comes down to something as important as “judging” someone and having an impact on their livelihood, I one hundred percent believe one size fits absolutely no one. Employees are people, with real thoughts and personalities of their own. They are not sheeple. Though some may seem this way. While I do not believe in the participation trophy, I do believe every employee should be evaluated on his or her individual performance criteria. If you hire an employee, you are hiring an “adult”, and just as every person is uniquely different so should their reviews be uniquely different. Some people may fit the one through three (good, ok, bad) rating, but other people will fall under the Graphic Scale, while others still will fall under the BARS, and yet some will just fall by a bar. I am about one hundred percent sure this is not the answer you are looking for but Sir, sometimes the book, as well as the answers we seek are wrong.</div>

5.  <header>Consider a job you have had in the past, or a job you would like to have. How might you use wearables to measure your performance in this role? How would you feel about that company monitoring your behaviors using this technology?</header>
<h1>CTQ Answer 5:</h1>
<html>I can honestly say there is absolutely no way I would work for a company that had to micromanage their employees on this level. That is absolutely, insanely, crazy. In the Midwest we monitor our cattle with “wearables”. It prevents cattle theft, which is still a thing in the great Midwest. I do not know how much cattle experience you have however, I am pretty sure you know they do not have opposing thumbs. They do however, have what we refer to has “herd” mental. They blindly follow each other, and do not think for themselves. While many human beings may display a similar mental, I believe it is up to their “leaderships” to lead by example, and break this mental. I think wearables are good for certain things: time keeping, monitoring workouts, texting, more of the “leisurely” activities. I am honestly surprised at how worked up this question got me. I had not expected that, but on the other hand, my thoughts are “I need to chill, this is PSYC class, it is designed to mess with you.” Realistically though, wearables to monitor some jobs are not a bad thing. Astronauts, Divers, I am sure there are many more jobs or rather careers that I am not thinking of where wearables are actually helpful. At the end of the day, if you are not in the line of work similar to the above then I do not realistically see a reason for wearables from a performance stand point.</html>

<title>Chapter 5 Application Questions (AQ)</title>
1.	<heading>Imagine that when using a 360-degree performance appraisal system, an employee receives a rating of 3.5/5 from his supervisor, 4.2/5 from his peers, and 2.25/5 from his subordinates. What might be some reasons for these discrepancies? What would you recommend that this individual’s supervisor do to gain a better understanding of what these ratings indicate about the employee’s performance?</heading>
<h1>AQ Answer 1:</h1>
	<body><p>I believe the reasons for the discrepancies are simple. The supervisor is there to push to you to be the best you that you can be. The peers work shoulder to shoulder, and see the extra work that is put in daily. Peers see when you stay late, when you have solutions to their issues, and when you are able to point them in the correct direction when you do not have the solution to their issue. They also see you go with them to get resolution to the issue. (Now you both know.) Subordinates always see the error to your ways, and by this I mean your subordinates do not always have the whole picture making it difficult for them to understand why you make the decisions that you do, when you do. Subordinates are only to see the world at their level. </p>
	<p>I recommend this individuals supervisor seek out a lot more training, evaluated, and use the feedback they are given. Or this individuals supervisor could work harder and improve how they do their jobs. Or honestly, and I feel this one isn’t really an option but the book says it is, this individuals supervisor can simply cast aside the peers ratings. </p>
 	<p>I honestly feel a good supervisor will already have a solid idea of what these, as you call them “discrepancies” are caused by. There for having a better understanding of what these ratings indicate about the performance of the employee. Should this individual’s supervisor actually not understand these differences I would recommend the supervisor take a step back. Place himself or herself into the shoes of the peers, as well as, as you call them, the subordinates shoes. Try looking in from the outside, then try looking out from each side, as well as in.</p> </body>
2.	<heading>Imagine that, in order to assign grades on a group project, your professor requires all group members to provide ratings for one another, which he will consider in grading the project. One group member has been particularly troublesome—she has been argumentative, refuses to accommodate other group members’ schedules, and completes the bare minimum amount of work. Would you feel comfortable giving her a poor performance appraisal? Why or why not?</heading>
<h1>AQ Answer 2: </h1>
	<p>In response to the “trouble-maker” I would feel fine giving her a performance appraisal, as I would have addressed the situation well before it got all the way to performance appraisals. Only someone who was too busy being selfish, and concerned about how this behavior will make them feel. Or how are they going to deal with issuing performance appraisal when it comes up, would let it go on for that long. Sometimes people act, or behave in a unique way because they are unclear of how to process what they are going through. Or they really need someone to listen to the laundry list of crap they are going through. Maybe this trouble maker has lost their mentor, and feel they have no one to look to for guidance. This may result in this “trouble maker” behavior. Rarely are bad apples truly bad apples. I feel that there is to much emphasis in the world focusing on “how do I make my ‘kid’ behave??” and not enough sitting down, shutting up, and truly listening. If you clear your mind, and really listen to what is being said, most trouble makers will tell you how to resolve the situation. This small act will remove the need for hundreds of thousands of dollars in research. </p>
	
3.	<html>Once again, imagine that your professor has asked for your feedback on your fellow group members’ performance on a project. This time, you have a group member who is very proactive in volunteering and takes an active role; however, even though she tries very hard, she has a lot of trouble understanding concepts introduced in the class; as a result, often the work she does is not usable for the project. Would you feel comfortable giving her a poor performance appraisal? Why or why not?</html>
<h1>AQ Answer 3:</h1>
	<section>No I would not feel comfortable giving that performance appraisal. I truly believe if a team member fails it is because the “leader” has let them fail. The failure is no fault of the failing team member. If a student is failing, that means the professor failed as well. A good professor will ensure their group members get the concepts. Even if that means changing teaching styles, or completely stepping out of the teaching box. Yes some people seem impossible to work with, maybe even like they do not want to work with anyone period. The true question is: What has brought them to this point in their life? Why is that student so hard headed, and refuse to reference the book? Or why does it feel like such a struggle to get a simple “text book” response from them? Over and over again the finger gets pointed in the wrong direction. “Leaders” want to boast about “oh, I got promoted into leadership, I am awesome!”, or “Well of course I am perfect, so I got chosen to be the leader.” “I do not make mistakes, and you must do as I say.” Leaders tend to forget where they came from, and in forgetting they also forget what got them to where they are. </section>
4.	<header>In many work environments, employees can engage in organizational citizenship behaviors (acts that help coworkers or the organization, even though they are not part of their job), such as staying late to work on a project they are not normally a part of or speaking positively about the organization to other people. Should these behaviors be considered in a performance appraisal? Why or why not?</header>
<h1>AQ Answer 4:</h1>
	<h2>There was a time when this answer would have been yes it should be part of their performance appraisal as they are going above and beyond. However now that I have seen employees try to play things to their favor, my answer is no longer a simple yes. It is now a maybe. Did that employee accomplish their work along with the extra work? Or did their work fall by the wayside, in an effort to assist someone else to make them selves look good? I’m finding more and more the second part is the case. In which case the answer would be a yes and no. I would notate their work was not completed (a failed task) due to their willingness to assist someone else with nothing that has to do with their job. If that person was a shipper, and there was an extremely urgent item that needed to make it to a destination by a certain time for a presentation to a potential customer, and that shipment took priority over a standard shipment. It would be noted in their review in a positive light. To nutshell it, if the additional work does not compromise their normal work load, then this is a positive notation. If it compromises their daily work load in a negative way, then this is a negative notation. I guess either way the answer is yes. </h2>


5.	<footer>Think of a time when you worked with someone who did not perform as well as you believed he or she should. What sorts of things did this person do/not do that led to a poor performance? If you were asked to deliver feedback to this person, what would you say?</footer>
<h1>AQ Answer 5:</h1>
	<lul>A big thing that leads to poor performance is communication. If you do not communicate clearly, and openly you are setting the whole team up for failure. Telling higher up’s that you were not trained on something when you mess it up, knowing full well you were trained led to poor performance. Not taking ownership of their actions when it ended poorly, but taking ownership for something someone else had done that was a big success. I was not asked to deliver feed back, but I made the delivery anyway. I told “someone else” how their poor performance caused more work for others. How their short cut that only saved them 2 minutes, costed someone else further down the line 10 minutes. I have high expectations of my co-workers, and extremely high expectations of my “management”. With that said, my expectations of myself are ten times higher than the highest expectations of others. I am much more forgiving, and accepting of others than I am of myself. For if we do not hold our expectations of ourselves highest, how can we have any expectations of others? We must lead by example. I do not have a “leadership” title, but I was led by great leaders. When things are going wrong, and performances are poor, I often ask: What can I do to help you perform better. What can I do to help you hit that mark, or reach that goal? </lul>
<div>Other Questions (OQ)</div>
1.	<li>Which of the various rating formats do you think would be most effective to evaluate professors’ performance? Why?</li>
<h1>OQ Answer 1:</h1>
	<p>Evaluating a professors’ performance is not a job I would want. There are so many variables. Students not wanting to learn, or not wanting to accept what they are learning, I imagine would reflect poorly on a professors review. So many other things I am sure would be contributing factors that I am not aware of. I honestly can not even fathom evaluating someone’s performance, when I know nothing of their job. Sure you can have an extremely light, surface level idea, but that alone is no where near enough knowledge to evaluate someone’s performance on. You can have all the book smarts in the world, but if you don’t have any on the job smarts, then you are in no position to evaluate anyone. This is simply due to you can not capture every single situation in a book. When people are involved, you can end up with endless different possibilities. To answer your question in a way I recon you would like I would use BARS, because from what I have gathered so far teaching is about following protocol or procedures.</p>

2.	<head>As a CEO of a company, what are some important characteristics that you would want to build into the feedback environment of your company? Why?</head>
<h1>OQ Answer 2:</h1>
	<body>As of current I do not feel I can actually answer this. I am a grunt in my current employment position. I have been a grunt for the last 12 years, and if I stay with this company I will be a grunt until I retire. Thus being a CEO is not in my cards, and I have struggled against managements stupid changes for the sake of change because they said so for so long that I no longer have the ambition to be a person making calls such as these. I am taking this class as a requirement to get a degree that will maybe help me get into a new position within the company that currently employs me. A month ago when classes first started I thought: This is great! I’ll finally be able to understand the new management and their ways. However, today I realize the company I work for is hosed, and I was wishing on a falling star that this class would help in any way shape or form. I had high self expectations of not letting my new instructors down, or my wife. To night as I type this (late again) paper, I can hear the wife snoring away lol I am fully beginning to question my decision to return to “school”. More importantly, my apologies to you Sir. Psych most likely wasn’t my best decision.  </body>
