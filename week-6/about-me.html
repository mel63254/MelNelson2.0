              I grew up in Southwest Minnesota hunting, and fishing. I spent most summers outside with friends, returning home
              once the street lights came on. As I got older, I learned to appreciate them old dirt roads. They lead to new adventures,
              as well as new fishing holes. I quickly became familiar enough to navigate the whole corner of Minnesota without ever
              traveling on a surface road.

              I moved to southeast South Dakota when I turned 20. I resided there only a very short time. This is where 
              I began my career in logistics. It wasn't long before I realized South Dakota was no where near big enough for me. So 
              once again I packed up, and headed out west.

              At age 23 I moved to Portland, OR. I spent an amazing two years partying like my life depended on it. I met some amazing 
              folks down there, and learned a bit more about life before moving up here to the greater Seattle area. I've been up 
              here now just over 12 years. Just this last April I traveled to Thailand with my wife. Bangkok was amazing!! We have 
              since talked about returning, sooner than later.

    <p> Here Ang, and I make a stop while on our motorcycle trip up Hwy 101 in Washington state. 
      This picture was taken in a little town called Forks, where Twilight was filmed. 
      It's a rather cozy little town.
